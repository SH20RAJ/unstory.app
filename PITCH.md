# Unistory: The Campus Super App

## 1. Executive Summary

**Unistory** is the exclusive, verified social network for college students. We are unbundling LinkedIn, Tinder, and Eventbrite to create a single, cohesive platform for the 40M+ students in India who crave a community that actually _gets_ them.

## 2. The Problem

Student life is fragmented across platforms that weren't built for them.

- **Networking:** LinkedIn is too formal and intimidating for a 19-year-old.
- **Dating:** Tinder/Bumble are broad, generic, and full of bots or non-students.
- **Events:** Campus happenings are buried in WhatsApp groups, bulletin boards, or Instagram stories.
- **Community:** Anonymous apps (like YikYak) can be toxic, while public feeds lack verification.

**Result:** Students feel disconnected on the very campuses where they are supposed to thrive.

## 3. The Solution: Unistory

One app to rule the campus. A verified, student-only walled garden.

### 🛡️ Verified Trust

- **Barrier to Entry:** Exclusive sign-up via verified `.edu` / `.ac.in` college email domains.
- **Safety:** No bots, no outsiders. Just real students from your campus and others.

### 💖 Dating (The Hook)

- **Secret Crush:** Add up to 5 friends. If they add you back, it's a match. Low pressure, high reward.
- **Student-Only Swipe:** Tinder-like interface, but safer and more relevant because everyone is a verified student.

### 🚀 Community & Events (The Retention)

- **Hyper-Local Feed:** See what's buzzing on _your_ campus right now.
- **Events Discovery:** From hackathons to house parties, find your vibe.
- **Connect:** Smart recommendations for study buddies, gym partners, or co-founders based on shared interests.

## 4. Market Opportunity

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** 40 Million+ higher education students in India alone.
- **Engagement:** Gen Z spends 4+ hours/day on mobile. Unistory captures the social, romantic, and professional bandwidth of this demographic.
- **Expansion:** Start with India, expand to global university networks.

---

## 5. Why Now?

- **Post-Pandemic Connection:** Students are desperate for genuine, offline interaction after years of isolation.
- **Digital Fatigue:** They are tired of the "Algorithmic Feed" of Instagram and want purpose-driven connection (Dating, Jobs, Events).

---

## 6. Business Model

- **Freemium:** Free core features to drive mass adoption.
- **Premium (Unistory Gold):**
  - See who liked you.
  - Unlimited swipes.
  - "Ghost Mode" for anonymity.
- **B2B / Campus Partners:** Universities pay to broadcast official events or recruit for placements.
- **Hyper-local Ads:** Local cafes, bookstores, and brands targeting students.

## 7. The Vision

We aren't just building an app; we are building the **Digital Campus**. Unistory is the operating system for student life—from the day they get their admit letter to the day they graduate.

**Unistory: Find Your People.**
