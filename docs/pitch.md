# UNISTORY — INVESTOR PITCH DOCUMENT

## The Campus Operating System for Real-World Connection

---

# 1. Vision

Unistory is building the **default social layer for college life** — a verified campus network where students discover activities, friendships, collaboration, and relationships through real-world context instead of anonymous feeds or swipe-based dating.

The long-term vision is to become the **operating system for student identity and interaction** across campuses.

## Social media is not built for campus reality

Traditional platforms fail students because:

* Generic feeds do not reflect college life.

Students are hyper-connected digitally yet lack structured ways to coordinate real campus life.
